    @permissions_for(Foo)
    class ProjectPermissions(FooPermissions):

        def has_perm_wiggle(self):
            # Let's ask the Foo object
            return self.obj.user_can_wiggle(self.user)

        def get_perm_change_queryset(self):
            # Foo objects can be changed by their owners
            return Foo.objects.filter(user=self.user)
